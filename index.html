    <p>
        Taly! I really miss you today (I’m writing this a week in the past but I know I will still be missing you)!! Sorry I couldnt be there on one of your favorite holidays big head.. Got two dang tests on Monday on cardiology; how relevant, right?!? But Im very excited to see you this following week and share time together. Lots and lots of time together in the desert. I hope you like your flowers, I gave them an idea and I hope they execute it well?! haha… 
      </p>

      <p>
        This website has taken me hours even with the help of chatgpt; even tho there are not much details to it its been real tough to just work out the small details there is. So even though its simple I hope you appreciate it. 
      </p>

      <p>
       Also I used to believe I wasn’t the jealous type and never even thought about it; I thought I was just some nonchalant noncaring guy.. But you’ve made me realize I can be jealous; and not like in a crazy bad way haha but like in a I want you to myself and youre mine; in a non-controlling and respectful manner type of way..  I dont know where Im going with this.. I’ll still keep this in here i guess haha.. hmmm youve made me realize I can care so much about someone that I can be more vulnerable? that I can feel these emotions or get hurt, which you know im scared of, but youve really let down my walls whether you know it or not.. I may not show it but you make me comfortable and like give myself entirely? Like Im capable of feeling jealous.. thats crazy.. i dont know. And its not like I get jealous often but like yeah.. Im just shook that I am now a jealous type. 
      </p>

      <p>
       loll all this was just a prequel/monologue before the letter..
      </p>

      <p>
        I really miss your hugs, I think I took that for granted. Kind of crazy that we went from it being weird to hug as friends to I can probably just hug you for hours. I feel so at home with us being that close. I love when we become still, calm, and quiet and then I can start feeling your heartbeat on my chest. Then the way your head fits right underneath my chin and our arms align.. I think we were meant to fit eachother.. I can fall asleep in your arms so easily as well. Your hugs just make me think of what I believe home to be.. and I really love that. I love that I resonate the “idea” of home with you and my heart and state of being feels at rest. Time can stop and I’ll be happy being next to you. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I miss your subtle kisses you give me all over. I miss your slight touch on my face and when you rest your hand on my hand. I miss feeling those bony skinny long fingers. I miss your butterfly kisses, I thought it was so weird at first but I really love it now, something about feeling your cheek and your eyelashes tickle my eyes, very intimate. I miss rubbing your nose with my nose while I close my eyes and just being in that moment in time with you rubbing noses. I miss giving you forehead kisses, miss feeling that oil on my lips ahahhaa; and then you move your face all around cause you want kisses everywhere else on your face, Ms needy.. I miss your pretty light brown eyes and staring at eachother, I miss the way they look in the sun as they get even lighter; and your pretty eyelashes just make the perfect combo.. I miss touching and holding your face as I look into your eyes, feeling all the textures (huge pores and fuzzy hair bwahahhahahaha). I miss feeling your arms and back as I hug you ms skinny and bony lady. I miss feeling your thighs and legs, and I like that you noticed thats how I let you know im there when we are in public or around people. But its also because you make me feel safe and you are my ground and whenever I feel overwhelmed, awkward, or just feel like I need to connect with you; I reach out for you. I miss waking up and seeing that beautiful face every morning. I miss doordashing food with you. I miss coming home to you. I miss us struggling and figuring out life together and only having eachother. I miss living life with you and you being my whole world. You make me very happy.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Growing up I never imagined I would end up in Santa Barbara, hecks I didnt even know what Santa Barbara was until I was like 16. I didnt know I would stay there after college as I was so lost in life, but Im glad I did, maybe one of the single most important choices I’ve made. Now Santa Barbara will always have my heart because its the place I met my greatest friend and where I got to grow as a person with her. I knew I had to stay in SB probably the moment we kissed for the first time. I remember in graduation running across the field because I had this silly idea that I really wanted to see you. You would make my heart flutter and you didnt even know it yet. Tbh you’ve always in a way made me feel that way since the beggining, I knew there was something bound for the two of us. I forget how much I liked you throughout those years in undergrad, reflecting back I knew since freshman year. Since the time I stayed up with you to “study”.. I DONT STUDY. I was in denial a lot because yeah the situation. And then it came full circle because when you were done with school and lost in life and whether to leave SB; you had the guts to do what I couldn’t and own your feelings. I’m so happy you the man of the house and wear the pants because that was the start of the happiest years of my life. Everything I wanted I finally had and it felt so natrual to love you. I loved being your man and I loved that I got to finally hold you and kiss you, and take you on dates, and share more of my life with you. I loved being seen as a lover by you and I loved your affection and I loved that you finally saw me as more than just a friend. You truly just make my heart flutter.  
      </p>
        
      <p>
        As we start anew on this journey. I want to make sure I never forget how much you mean to me and how you make me feel. Which is why I wanted to make a website that can be online forever and easy to access? You mean the world to me and I want to be the best ever to you. I want to change my view on relationships and negative thoughts and associations I have of them; just for you. I would love and be so happy to calI you my wife one day. I dont want to lose you again. Stay tuned to have to eat ketchup again, soon… 
      </p>

      <p>
        I think you drive me to do more and to be better.. Because I want to be better for us and so that one day we can have a home, kids, a cat or two, and maybe a Mambo… and I think thats how I want to live my life from now on. You know not just for me, but for us? I want you to be intertwined in my mind and I want to stop being selfish and not only have my goals and desires in my head. I want the honeymoon phase to be forever.. I love you Taly and I want to show you that I love you, and show everyone else that I love you. I will make sure you are known and heard and that there are clear lines from now on. I promise I will put you first, our relationship first. You deserve that and so much more.
      </p>

      <p>
        You make me very very happy when I’m around you and I want to feel that forever. I hope I induce that same feeling in you…
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.
